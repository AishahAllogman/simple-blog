                        <p class="pragraph2 ">3 SIMPLE WAYS TO SECURE YOUR APPLE ID 
                                    As an Apple user, there are some recommended precautions you can take right away to secure your account.
                                     By taking advantage of these three security guidelines, you can better safeguard your personal information. .</p>

                        <ol ><li class="list">CREATE A STRONG PASSWORD & SECURITY QUESTIONS</li>
                            <p class="pragraph2 "> Nowadays, most websites require you to have a strong password, and Apple is no exception. According to Apple, 
                            your password must contain at least eight characters and implement lower and uppercase letters, and a minimum of one number. To strengthen your password even more, add extra characters, numerals, 
                            and symbols, such as asterisks and exclamation marks.

                            Apple also incorporates security questions as an extra method to safeguard your account details. These questions should be relatively easy for you to remember but difficult for others to figure out.
                             Combined with other identifying material, a strong security question helps Apple establish your identity when you contact their support staff or need to verify yourself online. You can select or 
                             change your security questions from your Apple ID account page..</p>

                            <li class="list"> SET UP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION </li>
                            <p class="pragraph2 ">Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an enhanced security level for your Apple ID when you log into an unrecognized or new device. With 2FA set up, you’re the only user who
                                 can access your account, even if your password is exposed or compromised. As you sign into a device for the first time, you’ll be prompted to enter the six-digit code displayed on your trusted 
                                 device of choice. When you enter the correct passcode, Apple will verify your identity and grant you access. To set up 2FA on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you must be running on iOS 9 or higher.
                                  Setting up on a Mac requires OS X El Capitan or later versions.</p>

                             <li class="list">AVOID PHISHING SCHEMES </li>
                            <p class="pragraph2 ">Phishing is a form of identity theft that website hackers use to steal your data. This can include personal info, such as your Apple ID login credentials and credit card information.
                                 Often, scammers will pose as a trusted source and trick you into opening an email or text with a fraudulent link. By submitting your information, hackers can use your identity, money, and, in worse cases,
                                  sell your personal information to other cybercriminals.

                                To avoid phishing, never open suspicious emails or messages. If you come across a website appearing fake or misleading, don’t type in any personal inf..</p>
